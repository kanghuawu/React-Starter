# React Starter

This is a front-end boilerplate using [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org). When ever I am about to start a new project, I would just copy the code here and start extending. The React code here includes following functionalities:

* Navbar
* [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
* [redux-form](https://redux-form.com/7.2.3/)
* [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
* Higher order component for authentication
* Setup webpack and babel configeration

## Dependencies

* node v9.5.0+
* npm 5.6.0+
